//! The `NetworkTransport` trait — the boundary that quarantines libp2p (spec §6.3.1, §10.1).
//!
//! Everything above this trait (Creda Core, M5) speaks in terms of buckets, batches, DHT keys,
//! and event ids — never libp2p types. The spec is explicit (§6.3.1) that the networking layer
//! is abstracted behind a trait so libp2p "can be replaced if necessary without restructuring
//! the rest of the system" — for binary size, API stability, or health-IT compliance review.
//!
//! The production implementation is [`crate::libp2p_adapter::Libp2pTransport`] (feature
//! `libp2p`). A test/loopback implementation for the multi-peer test bed (DQ-3) is a planned
//! follow-up that lands with Core (M5).
//!
//! The methods are `async` (native async-fn-in-trait, stable since Rust 1.75). That makes the
//! trait not `dyn`-object-safe, so Core holds a concrete transport or is generic over
//! `T: NetworkTransport` rather than a `Box<dyn NetworkTransport>`. This is intentional — the
//! transport is chosen once at peer startup, not swapped at runtime.
